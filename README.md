## GitHub Pages Deployment

This project is set up to be hosted on GitHub Pages. The static content is served directly from the `/docs` directory.

### Deployment Steps

1. Generate the static files (this is already done, the files are in the `/docs` directory):
   ```
   ./generate_static.py
   ```

2. Push the code to GitHub:
   ```
   # If you haven't set up git yet
   ./init_git.sh
   
   # Then add your remote and push
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/3d-cube-spinner.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Navigate to Settings â†’ Pages
   - Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Select the "main" branch and the "/docs" folder
   - Click "Save"
   - Wait a few minutes for GitHub to deploy your site

4. Your site will be available at `https://your-username.github.io/3d-cube-spinner/`

### Troubleshooting GitHub Pages

If your deployment is not working:

1. Check that your repository contains the `/docs` directory with all the static files
2. Ensure the `.nojekyll` file exists in the `/docs` directory
3. Verify that GitHub Pages is enabled in your repository settings
4. Check the GitHub Pages build logs for any errors
